This theme improves upon Rainglow's Lavender (Contrast) theme with

- A darker terminal background
- A coloured highlight for both, the active editor tabs as well as dirty tabs
- Improved statusbar visibility; the colour of the statusbar indicates whether a workspace or a folder is open or not.

Lilac was designed to be aesthetically pleasant and caters to the pastel-goth chick within me.

The theme is also available for the Firefox browser and the Hyper terminal.
